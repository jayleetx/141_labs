```{r global_options, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval = FALSE)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(oilabs)
data(survey141)
```

## Setup

This lab will focus on generating plots using the `ggplot2` package, as well as 
practicing data subsetting with the `filter()` command from the `dplyr` package. 
To get started, load the following packages and data set.


```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(oilabs)
data(survey141)
```

This data comes from the class survey that you were asked to complete; however, the data frame 
we'll be using has been slightly altered to make generating plots easier. The column names 
of the data set have been changed as well. The help file contains the original questions. 

```{r}
?survey141
```

To see a messier version of the data set, `oilabs` also contains `survey141_messy`.

## Plot Types

The `ggplot` command is used to create a base layer for a plot, with `aes()` used to specify
which visual cues to connect to variables in a data frame. After creating this base layer, a
geometry can be applied which will render a specific type of plot. 

```{r eval = TRUE}
d <- ggplot(survey141, aes(x = hot_dog, fill = dog_pants))
d + geom_bar()
```

Above a base layer for the survey data is created with `hot_dog` mapped to the x-axis and `dog_pants` mapped to fill (a color 
based visual cue). This base layer is assigned to `d` and then a bar plot layer is added to it via `geom_bar()`.

The following geoms are some of the most commonly used:

    - `geom_bar()`:         for a categorical variables
    - `geom_histogram()`:   for a numerical variable
    - `geom_density()`:     for a numerical variable
    - `geom_boxplot()`:     for a numerical variable and possibly a categorical variable
    - `geom_point()`:       for 2 numerical variables
    - `geom_smooth()`:      for 2 numerical variables
    
Multiple geometries may be layered on top of each other, as is often the case with 
`geom_smooth()` and `geom_point()` to create scatter plots with trend lines.
    
1. Create a density plot for the number of colleges applied to. What does this
distribution look like?

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey141, aes(x = college_app)) + geom_density()
```

## Filtering Data

Often times there will be entries in data sets that you'll want to exclude. 
This is when the `filter()` command will be useful. `filter()` will take a 
data set and find all rows that return true under set conditions. 

The following example has the `survey141` data being filtered to only include 
rows which have "Tea" as the response for the `coffee_tea` variable. This subset 
of the original survey data is then assigned to a new data frame called `tea_drinkers`.

```{r}
tea_drinkers <- filter(survey141, coffee_tea == "Tea")
```

The following uses the piping operator to apply a filter to `survey141`, filtering out only
those rows which have 0 in the `marijuana` variable, **and** a value greater than 0 in the
`alcohol` variable. 

```{r}
alcohol_only <- survey141 %>% filter(alcohol > 0 & marijuana == 0)
```

Pulling up the help file will give a list of useful filter functions and more examples
of the function in use.

1.  Filter out those who answered PC or Mac to the computer of choice question. 
Create a side-by-side box plot comparing the first kiss age between the groups.
Do you notice any differences between the two groups? If so, what are they?
(Note: if the box plot does not render correctly, try switching the x and y assignments.)

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
filter(survey141, computer == "PC" | computer == "Mac") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = computer, y = first_kiss)) + geom_boxplot()
```

## Settings, Labels and Limits

Beyond aesthetics and geometries, `ggplot2` also has settings and labels for customizing 
visualizations.

Settings are options one can apply to a plot, but unlike aesthetics, they are not directly linked to a variable.

```{r eval = TRUE}
ggplot(survey141, aes(x = hot_dog, fill = dog_pants)) + geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

In the above example, the setting `position = "fill"` is used on geom_bar so that count is no longer 
displayed, but instead proportion. 

1.  Using `position = "jitter"` create a scatter plot relating `alcohol` and `marijuana`. 

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
p <- ggplot(survey141, aes(x = alcohol, y = marijuana)) + geom_point(position = "jitter")
p
```

Beyond geoms, additional layers such as `labs()` and `xlim()` can be added to a plot, used to 
add labels/titles and axis limits respectively. These layers are added on just like a geom would, 
and can help add clarity or focus in on a specific part of a plot.

1. Give more descriptive axes labels and specify limits for the previous plot to remove more 
extreme cases. Describe any relationship or lack thereof. How do these last two plots compare to 
your personal estimates?

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
p + xlim(-1, 5) + ylim(-1, 5) + labs(x = "something", y = "something else")
```

```{r}
# shill for ggthemes and purely aesthetic options
```

## More Practice

1.  Create 2-3 more visualizations from the survey data that are of interest to you.
Have at least one visualization come from a filtered subset of the data, and have at
least one more map 3 or more variables. Describe any trends/patterns discovered.

```{r echo = FALSE}
# After some time working on this have people share what they've found
```

1.  Recreate the following plot. The help file for `geom_smooth()` will be useful.
(Hint: The settings used for geom_smooth() are `method` and `se`)

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey141, aes(x = economic, y = social, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  xlim(0,10) +
  ylim(0,10) + 
  labs(title = "Political Views and Gender", 
       subtitle = "1 - Extremely Liberal, 10 - Extremely Conservative", 
       x = "Economic Views",
       y = "Social Views",
       color = "Gender Identity")
```
